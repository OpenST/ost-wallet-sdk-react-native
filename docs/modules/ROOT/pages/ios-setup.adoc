= iOS setup required for OST React Native SDK
:doctype: book

== 1. Installing https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage]

Get https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage] by running following command on terminal

[source,bash]
----
 brew install carthage
----

You can also choose https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/#installing-carthage[other methods] to install https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage]

== 2. Downloading OST React Native SDK using Carthage

Carthage looks at a file called `Cartfile` to determine which libraries to install.
Create a file in the `./ios` directory of your react-native project called `Cartfile` and enter the following to tell Carthage which dependencies we want:

Add following entry in your `Cartfile`

[source,bash]
----
 github "ostdotcom/ost-wallet-sdk-ios" == 2.3.6
----

Now to actually install everything run the following in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
 carthage update --platform iOS
----

A `Cartfile.resolved` file and a `Carthage` directory will appear in the same directory where your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` is.

== 3. Copying the `OstWalletSdk.framework` file in your Xcode project

Open your project in Xcode, click on the project file in the left section of the screen and scroll down to the `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` section in Xcode.

`Carthage` folder will have the `.framework` files that we will add in Xcode project.

Now open the `./ios/Carthage/Build/iOS` folder in Finder:

Run this command

[source,bash]
----
open ios/Carthage/Build/iOS
----

Open application target, under General tab, drag the built `OstWalletSdk.framework` binary from `./ios/Carthage/Build/iOS` folder into Linked Frameworks and Libraries section.

== 4. Adding the `OstWalletSdk` dependencies in your Xcode project

We need to add the `.framework` files of dependencies present inside `./ios/Carthage/Build/iOS`.

Open `application targets` in Xcode.
Under `Build Phases` click `+` icon and choose `New Run Script Phase`.
Add the following command.

[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
----

Click the `+` under `Input Files` and add the following entry framework:

----
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Alamofire.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/BigInt.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/CryptoEthereumSwift.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/CryptoSwift.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/EthereumKit.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/FMDB.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SipHash.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/TrustKit.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/OstWalletSdk.framework
----

== 5. Add additional SDK files

Follow these steps to add additional files:

* Click on your project, select `File > Add Files to "<Your Project>"`
* Browse to `./node_modules/@ostdotcom/ost-wallet-sdk-react-native/ios`
* Add the folder `ostwalletrnsdk` with following settings:
 ** Destination: (uncheck) Copy items if needed
 ** Added folders: (select) Create groups

== 6. Change Build Settings

Open application target, under `Build Settings` tab, enable `Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries` under `Build Options`

== 7. Create SDK configuration file

Create `OstWalletSdk.plist` file.
This file has configuration attributes used by OstWalletSdk.
You should copy paste the configuration values from below snippet.

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
 <plist version="1.0">
 <dict>
    <key>BlockGenerationTime</key>
    <integer>3</integer>
    <key>PricePointTokenSymbol</key>
    <string>OST</string>
    <key>PricePointCurrencySymbol</key>
    <string>USD</string>
    <key>RequestTimeoutDuration</key>
    <integer>30</integer>
    <key>PinMaxRetryCount</key>
    <integer>3</integer>
    <key>SessionBufferTime</key>
    <integer>3600</integer>
    <key>UseSeedPassword</key>
	<false/>
    <key>EnableIOSDeviceRestore</key>
	<false/>
 </dict>
 </plist>
----

. BlockGenerationTime: The time in seconds it takes to mine a block on auxiliary chain.
. PricePointTokenSymbol: This is the symbol of base currency.
So its value will be OST.
. PricePointCurrencySymbol: It is the symbol of quote currency used in price conversion.
. RequestTimeoutDuration: Request timeout in seconds for https calls made by ostWalletSdk.
. PinMaxRetryCount: Maximum retry count to get the wallet Pin from user.
. SessionBufferTime: Buffer expiration time for session keys in seconds.
Default value is 3600 seconds.
. UseSeedPassword: The seed password is salt to PBKDF2 used to generate seed from the mnemonic.
When UseSeedPassword set to `true`, different deterministic salts are used for different keys.
. EnableIOSDeviceRestore: When EnableIOSDeviceRestore is set to `true`, After app re-installation, SDK checks for available device key in Keychain for given user id.

*These configurations are MANDATORY for successful operation.
Failing to set them will significantly impact usage.*
